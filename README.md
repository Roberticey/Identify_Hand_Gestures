# Identify_Hand_Gestures
This repository is for the python script which identifies numbers from 0 to 5 in sign language.
A model is trained using tensorflow and then this model is used to predict the number based on the gesture 'seen' by the webcam.
The jupyter file show how the model is trained.
The main.py script uses the input from the webcam and feeds it throught the trained model and implements certain operations based on the prediction.
